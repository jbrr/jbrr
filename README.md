I'm Jeff, I live in Denver, Colorado, USA, and I think I'm funnier than I actually am. I have 8 years of experience in software and data engineering. I like to solve puzzles, collaborate with technical and non-technical folks, and build stuff. Former: frieght train conductor, warehouse worker, philosophy student experiencing constant existential crisis.

I'm currently on the job hunt. My recent experience has been in the data engineering space, but I've worked across the web development stack throughout my career. I'm most comfortable with Python, SQL, and Scala, but always down to learn new things. Do you love where you work and have an opening? I wanna talk to you about it!

I love open source and have made [a](https://github.com/Kapeli/cheatsheets/commit/73d574743d3bda4c7fc17226a9e3a3f5b9c410c4) [few](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/ef97b89902f03d710f6111a1d8deaaa87d92a817) [modest](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/7984/commits/47d8ac322326483b21de57db54add4f2b5420ddb) [contributions](https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/68ecff91b87aa14e4730c4c0f40bcb724c1b83d8) to large projects, but haven't found something to really sink my teeth into. You need help with your project, even if it's just grunt work? Hit me up!

I deeply believe in the power of labor organizing, and I'm always looking for projects to work on supporting that cause, whether technical or non-technical. Want to find out if some corporation is engaging in wage theft and somehow have access to some large dataset that might shed light on it? Hit me up, I'll drop everything.

I also deeply believe in the greatness of the Denver Nuggets basketball club. Want to chat about Jokić? Hit me up. Think Luka is better? Let's take this outside (and have a vigorous agruement where we agree to disagree over coffee or something, I donno).

I like taking photographs too, and occassionally still post to [flickr](https://flickr.com/photos/eioua). I'm currently rocking a Fujifilm XT-5 and trying to get better with the [KamLan 50mm f/1.1](https://www.kamlan.shop/products/50mm-f-1-1-mk2). I wanna talk about photography with you!

Take care of each other, these are tough times.
